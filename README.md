# Opensea Clone

I built Opensea Clone to master my development skills. Built with typescript and React.js for the front-end, Thirdweb SKD for blockchain connection, and Firebase for the backend. Opensea Clone allows users to log in and customize their accounts with Metamask as well as mint, buy and sell NFTs.
